# Cyclistic_Case_Study_Google_Analytics WORK IN PROGRESS
Case Study from Google Analytics Course 

# Introduction
In this case study, I will be using the data analysis process and steps to demostrate my understanding and answer real-world questions from this fictional company.

Data Link: [divvy_tripdata](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) this will be the data used for the Cyclistic company

# Scenario
Working as a junior data analyst in the marketing team for Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company based in Chicago. 
My task is to identify and analyze usage patterns of customer groups, casual riders and annual members riders. 
The goal is to find key differences in how these two groups use the bikes in order to find a good marketing strategy
that is aimed to converting casual riders into annual members. 

__Steps__:
* Ask
* Prepare
* Process
* Analyze
* Share
* Act

# Key Objectives
* Analyzing data to identify trends and patterns in usage between the causal and members riders
* Find differences that will help convert casual riders to members
* Analyze data and provide visualizations that clearly show the findings
* Use the insights to help create a marketing strategy to increase annual memberships

This analysis will provide the marketing team with a way to convert casual riders to annual members.

# About Cyclistic and 
Cyclistic is a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart
by also o ering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities
and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use
the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each
day.

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are
geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to
any other station in the system anytime.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One
approach that helped make these things possible was the exibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and
annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who
purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing
flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Lily Moreno (director of marketing) believes that maximizing the number of annual 
members wil be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there 
is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have
chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do
that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual
riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in
analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

# Prepare

I'll be using April 2020 to September 2020 data.
